;; Open things only in the current window. No other windows, no splits.


;;; Code:

;;;; Customization

(defgroup current-window-only nil
  "Open things only in the current window. No other windows, no splits."
  :prefix "current-window-only-"
  :group 'frames)

;;;; Modes

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode current-window-only-mode
  "Open things only in the current window. No other windows, no splits."
  :global t
  (if current-window-only-mode
      (current-window-only--on)
    (current-window-only--off)))

;;;; Variables

;; Some modes and packages need to be explicitly said how to behave.
;; This is the list of variables that this package is going to modify.
(defvar Man-notify-method)
(defvar org-src-window-setup)
(defvar org-agenda-window-setup)

;; We want to rember the variable values that user had before activating the
;; `current-window-only-mode' in case he decides to disable it. In that case
;; we want to set the variables to their previous values instead of the
;; default ones.
(defvar current-window-only--old-config '())

;;;; Functions

;;;;; Private

(defun current-window-only--on ()
  ;; Remember the user configuration in case we need to restore it

      (setf (alist-get var current-window-only--old-config)
            (symbol-value var))))

  ;; The `display-buffer-alist' is still a magic to me but in the ideal world
  ;; this should be the only necessary setting.
  (setq display-buffer-alist
        '((".*" (display-buffer-reuse-window
                 display-buffer-same-window)

  ;; Some packages require a custom configuration just for them
  (setq Man-notify-method 'pushy)
  (setq org-src-window-setup 'current-window)
  (setq org-agenda-window-setup 'current-window)

  ;; The `org-agenda', `org-capture', and probably all commands with the
  ;; similar input field that expects one character and blocks all other input,
  ;; don't respect the `display-buffer-alist' variable and appear in some other
  ;; window. Overriding `switch-to-buffer-other-window' helps.

  ;; Commands like `org-agenda' and `org-capture' temporarily maximize some
  ;; window, change layout, and/or close all other windows when they are
  ;; finished. This prevents them from doing so.
