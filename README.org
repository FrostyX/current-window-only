* ~M-x current-window-only~

Open things only in the current window. No other windows, no splits.

In the ideal world, this package should not be necessary and one would
simply configure ~display-buffer-alist~ to display buffers only in the
current window. But not all commands respect this variable
(e.g. ~org-agenda~), and so this package implements multiple tricks to
achieve the desired behavior.

** Obligatory GIF section

My apologies for not recording key presses. I am basically just
hitting enter to open things and ~q~ to close things.

** Installation

The package is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/current-window-only][MELPA]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package current-window-only
  :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Motivation

The [[DemystifyingEmacs][Demystifying Emacs’s Window Manager]] article
provides a great explanation of the key concepts, behavior, and
configuration of the window manager. Are you ready for the red pill
and seeing how deep the rabbit hole goes? The rest of us want
reasonable behavior without being required to understand.

In short, a user can adjust how buffers should be displayed by adding
new rules to the ~display-buffer-alist~ variable. The general
consensus is that the rules are just too cryptic, too complicated, and
not many people understand them. As a consequence third-party packages
such as ~shackle~ and ~popwin~ appeared, allowing to define
human-readable rules.

My humble guess is that the majority of people add rules for Emacs to
stop breaking their /splits/, to open things in the current window,
and nothing else. Why define some rules in the first place, when
you can simply ~M-x current-window-only~?

** Tips and tricks

You might need to adjust some workflows after enabling the package.

*** Magit commit

When creating a new commit, Magit spawns two buffers - diff with file
changes and a commit message. It is useful to see the changes while
writing the commit message but with ~current-window-only~, they will
open in the same window and therefore only one of them remains
visible. This is consistent with the goals of this package but if you
don't like it, you can:

- Use ~evil-switch-to-windows-last-buffer~ or ~C-x b RET~ to easily
  jump back and forth between the two buffers within one window.
- Move the cursor to any appropriate window and manually open the
  other Magit buffer there
- Use ~(setq magit-commit-diff-inhibit-same-window t)~ to sidestep
  ~current-window-only~

*** Explicitly use other window

This package overrides the original ~switch-to-buffer-other-window~ function so
that it doesn't use the "other" window, and use the current window instead. This
hack is needed to disallow random Emacs commands from using what windows they
want. However, someone may want a custom command which ignores this hack.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun switch-to-buffer-other-window-force ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((override #'current-window-only--switch-to-buffer-other-window))
    (advice-remove 'switch-to-buffer-other-window override)
    (call-interactively #'switch-to-buffer-other-window)
    (advice-add 'switch-to-buffer-other-window :override override)))
#+END_SRC

Running ~M-x switch-to-buffer-other-window-force~ will open the buffer in
"other" window even when ~current-window-only-mode~ is enabled.

The same can be done for ~delete-other-windows~ and other adviced
functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun delete-other-windows-force ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((override #'current-window-only--delete-other-windows))
    (advice-remove 'delete-other-windows override)
    (delete-other-windows)
    (advice-add 'delete-other-windows :override override)))
#+END_SRC
